All of these files except the `macro_descriptions.properties` file
will go away when the project of converting the wiki's HTML to
something the MT macro editor can use has been completed.

I will likely leave the runtime scripts here, though, since the
simplest way to add help docs for a new macro function help may be
to add it to the wiki, then extract it here.  A different process
will be needed in the future because that's just dumb.
