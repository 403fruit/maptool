MapTool

Start of the new MapTool build. 
I have just started moving things over so it doesn't do everything that the old build system did (yet).



To run 
./gradle run          (or gradlew.bat run)




As a stop gap I have added the application plugin to the gradle build

./gradlew distZip      (or gradlew.bat distZip)
Will build a zip file so you can at least test things.

from the zip use either bin/maptool or bin/maptool.bat to run.
